# TODO

-   [x] Get rid of computer modern font
-   [x] Consider everything in EB Garamond or Palatino
-   [ ] Despaghettify:
    -   [x] Index should be a special page
    -   [ ] Condense parts such that a part represents either a re-usable component, or a section of content for a page.
    -   [x] Put as many things in texts as possible, such that a text is a re-usable text element.
-   [ ] Clean up scss files, get rid of unused rules
-   [ ] Consistent color scheme, only one (or two) reds
