# About

Founded by Jesse Brault and Will Stackpole, **Red Dog Ensemble** is a collaboration of young musical minds who seek to create and perform music not only relevant for our time but also engaging, fresh, and beautiful. A collection of composers, instrumentalists, and a conductor, _Red Dog_ hopes to deliver to its audiences both entertaining and meaningful experiences, exploring the music making ritual through means both traditional and conceptually inventive.

_Red Dog's_ first project is recording an album at Avaloch Farm Institute in the fall of 2019. The album will feature four new compositions by the talented and up-and-coming composers Jon Cziner, Sato Matsui, Tom Morrison, and Mr. Stackpole himself, and will be debuted on streaming services soon following. Mr. Brault will conduct the ensemble for this debut recording. After recording their album together, _Red Dog_ will perform concerts and recitals in the New York City area, sharing the culmination of their recording process with live audiences and expanding their repertoire to include additional up-and-coming composers.

_Red Dog Ensemble_ is affectionately named after Ginger, Mr. Stackpole's energetic and charming dog. A rescue dog, she resides in New York City where she enjoys long walks through Inwood Hill Park.
