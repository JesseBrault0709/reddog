# About

Founded by Jesse Brault and Will Stackpole, **Red Dog Ensemble** is a collaboration of young musical minds who seek to create and perform music not only relevant for our time but also engaging, fresh, and beautiful. A collection of composers, instrumentalists, and a conductor, _Red Dog_ hopes to deliver to its audiences both entertaining and meaningful experiences, exploring the music making ritual through means both traditional and conceptually inventive.

_Red Dog's_ first project was recording an album at Avaloch Farm Institute in the fall of 2019. The album features four new compositions by the talented and up-and-coming composers Jon Cziner, Sato Matsui, Tom Morrison, and Mr. Stackpole himself. Mr. Brault conducted the ensemble for this debut recording.

_Red Dog Ensemble_ is affectionately named after Ginger, Mr. Stackpole's energetic and charming dog. A rescue dog, she resides in New York City where she enjoys long walks through Inwood Hill Park.
