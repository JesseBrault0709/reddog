Hello, world! My name is Jesse Brault, and I am the conductor and co-founder of _Red Dog Ensemble_. We are just a few days away from beginning our residency at Avaloch Farm Institute, and we are so excited! While at Avaloch, we will embark upon our innagural project: recording an album of four new works composed just for us. As you can see above, the composers have delivered their scores, hot off the press! They are all so different musically, ranging from transparent, mystical sound worlds to complicated collages of musical ideas. It has been very gratifying for me to prepare these pieces to conduct!

The musicians are all busy preparing their parts (and hopefully packing!). This coming Monday we will depart New York City early in the morning—coffeed up, fueled up, Spotify playlists queued up—and ready for the beautiful drive up to New Hampshire. We will start in with the project right away on Tuesday, with several hours of rehearsal and setup.

I can personally say that I am very excited and grateful to be delving deeply into beautiful new works by my peers, to take time to enjoy idyllic New Hampshire in October, and also to eat the near-famous-in-the-classical-music-world food that is served to all the artists in residence at the institute. And best of all, it's going to be a blast to do this project with some of my favorite musicians and friends!

Stay tuned for more updates from myself, the composers, and the ensemble, and feel free to drop us a note on the Contact page!
