A clarinetist, writer, and marketing consultant, **John Hong** has enjoyed plaudits from The New York Times for playing “quirky theatrical and musical elements with aplomb” and from The Chicago Tribune for his “deft solo playing.”

Performance highlights include appearances with the American Ballet Theatre and Lincoln Center’s MostlyMozart Festival, as well as his concerto debut with the Wiener Residenzorkester, with whom he performed Mozart in Vienna’s St. Stephens Cathedral—the very chapel where the composer was married. While he has taken the stage in venues across the world, much of Hong’s work falls outside the bounds of traditional classical performance. Engagements have taken him to play on boats in Maine, skyscraper lobbies in New York City, mansions in the Hamptons, and select guest appearances on YouTube channel JHMJams. His most notable appearance on the channel is performing La La Land’s “Another Day of Sun”, a video that would go on to rack up over 500,000 views and be recognized by Lionsgate Entertainment.

Outside performing, Mr. Hong acts as an independent marketing consultant and ghostwriter. While he has consulted real estate agents and coffee companies, his main work is with those in the performing arts: his clientele includes GRAMMY® winners, nonprofit executives, orchestra CEOs, ensembles, and musicians of all stripes from the six major continents. (The search for an Antarctican client remains ongoing.)

Praised by New Yorker contributor Steve Smith for “having his thumb square on the pulse of what moves the public to open up a story”, John has written widely read essays on sexual harassment in classical music, interviews of the Emmy winning television series Mozart in the Jungle producers and lead actors, and a bevy of profiles, including of flutist Michelle Sung’s miraculous recovery from focal dystonia, violist turned nationally televised comedian Isabel Hagen, and Instagram star Drew “ThatViolaKid” Forde.

Mr. Hong holds a Master of Music from The Juilliard School, from which he was one of ten students to receive the school’s coveted $10,000 entrepreneurship grant. He has since returned to Juilliard as a paid speaker on entrepreneurship in the arts, and has spoken about career development to students at the Lynn Conservatory of Music, Blair School of Music at Vanderbilt University, and Samford University.

He is immensely grateful to the time, patience, and wisdom of his pedagogues: Jon Manasse, Lauren Jacobson, Bil Jackson, and Janet DuBois. Currently, he serves as the principal clarinetist for the Washington Heights Chamber Orchestra in New York.

Mr. Hong makes his home in Ottawa, Canada; he is often spotted in New York City’s Asian noodle establishments or, less frequently, performing in his current position as the principal clarinetist of the Washington Heights Chamber Orchestra.
