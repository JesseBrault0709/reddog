Will Stackpole is an American composer whose music has been called "lively” and possessing a "savage charm" by the New York Times. Stackpole's works have been played across the country by many notable ensembles including the New Jersey Symphony Orchestra, the Levin/Davin Duo, and the Juilliard Orchestra. He began his musical career as an electric guitarist and recording engineer, primarily performing in rock bands in his home state of New Hampshire and later in Hoboken, New Jersey. In college, Will began writing concert music and quickly developed a unique compositional voice. He spent two years studying composition with Justin Dello Joio while working in New York as a freelance composer and orchestrator for theater, film, and television. Mr. Stackpole has since refocused his efforts on creating conceptually innovative concert music. His work blends a wide spectrum of influences: from rock to opera and from Miles Davis to Dutilleux.

Stackpole's music often shows an affinity for vibrant, shifting colors that move within a rich rhythmic framework. Many of his works contain a narrative of sorts, touching on themes that are particularly relevant to present events, at times even political. _...Ask Questions Later_, premiered in 2016 by the NJSO, highlights the inevitable consequences of gun violence by exploring a musical landscape that takes place in the time between an outburst and an impact. His most recent orchestral work _fEED_, was the recipient of the 2019 Rudolf Nissim Prize from the ASCAP Foundation. The piece looks inward at the effects of social media and 24-hour political news on our experience of the world around us.

Stackpole holds a B.A. in Music and Technology from Stevens Institute of Technology and an M.M. in Composition from the Juilliard School, where he was the two-time winner of the Juilliard Orchestra Competition. His teachers have included Robert Beaser, Melinda Wagner, Justin Dello Joio, and Andy Brick. In addition to his output as a composer, Stackpole's work as a conductor, producer, and audio engineer have led him to work in many different media. He has composed for and designed projects in theater, film, television, and dance. He is currently a C.V. Starr Doctoral Fellow at the Juilliard School where he is completing his dissertation, “Steven Stucky: His Life and Music,” and is a composition instructor and adjunct professor at Stevens Institute of Technology in Hoboken, NJ.
